# ACTProject
Creating a program for Alaska Coach Tours to help them with scheduling. They currently spend about 6 hours to schedule
their tours every night due to the cruise ships giving them the excursions the night before. Our goal is to make these 6 
hours exponentially shorter. Our vision is this program will take 2 excel documents with the tours to be done the next 
day on one document and and the employees' names and current hours worked on a different document. Our program will then 
assign the various tours to the employees equally and save a new document with the assignments and new current hours
worked.
